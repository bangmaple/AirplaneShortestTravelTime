Data Structure and Algorithm II
Lecturer: Bùi Thanh Hùng (hung.buithanhcs@gmail.com)

Using supplied data and implementing application to find the route (i.e., sequence of flights) from a given airport at a provided start time to a desired destination airport in the shortest amount of time.
Requirement:
-	Understand that the graph representation of the flights between the airports can simply be represented by maintaining a list of outgoing flights from each airport. (This is just an adjacency list representation of the graph.)
-	Understand of shortest path algorithms to create the variation of it that is required to address the layover cost that occurs when the traveller is waiting at an intermediate airport between flights.
-	Apply in a real problem
Function:
-	Load data from text file
-	Find the the route (i.e., sequence of flights) from a given airport at a provided start time to a desired destination airport in the shortest amount of time.
